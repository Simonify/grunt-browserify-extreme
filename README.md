grunt-browserify-*EXTREME*
========================

Yet another module to enable browserify support in Gruntjs. All the other extensions I found (I literally spent a whole 2 minutes searching) were designed for either older versions of Grunt or older versions of Browserify. So I spent 5 minutes building this instead of looking around github. It's not tested, so don't use it in production. Or do. I'm a README, not a cop.
